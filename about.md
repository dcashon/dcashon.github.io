Welcome to my blog! Here I hope to share any useful knowledge about computing -
particularly from the perspective of an engineer. I graduated from the
Department of Aeronautics & Astronautics at the University of Washington in
2017\. I then had a brief stint working at the Princeton Plasma Physics
Laboratory near Princeton University before returning to Seattle to work on the
Mitsubishi Regional Jet Program. After about a year, I returned to the
University and completed my M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics. My interest, broadly
speaking, is how to effectively use the vast number of computational tools now
available to solve engineering problems, whether that be in aerospace or any
other field.
